#Tweet-with-media

Rationale:

I felt like Twitters documentation wasn't that obvious, so wanted to push this to the public incase someone was looking for an up to date, working method.

Some of the media url links were different sizes, so I added a function to resize them.

A challenging part is getting your tokens. Go to the developer portal, and get your api key, api key secret, acess token & access token secret.

Within the app settings in the developer portal, you need to modify the APP Permissions field to enable OAuth 1.0a Authentication to have READ AND WRITE permissions or this function won't work.
